        "  + You may need additional libraries besides the Python standard library to solve some questions. Import only necessary libraries. \n",
        "  + If more than one library exist for a same purpose, choose the one you wish as long as it does the task properly. \n",
        "  + If we want you to use a specific library, then we will state it clearly. \n",
        "  + Use the exact variable names asked in the questions. When no clear instructions given, feel free to do it the way you would like to.\n",
        "  + After each question, add the needed number of new cells and place your answers inside the cells. \n",
        "  + Use text cells for explanations. Use explanation and plain text as much as possible. \n",
        "  + Do not remove or modify the original cells provided by the instructor.\n",
        "  + In the following cell you will find some extra options to make your code more readable, including output colors RED, OKBLUE, or output text styles like BOLD or UNDERLINE that. Do not hesitate to use them. As an example, one may output text in red as follows: \n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "     print(bcolors.RED + \"your text\" + bcolors.ENDC)\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "  + Comment your code whenever needed using # sign at the beginning of the row.\n",
        "  + In some questions some of the details needed for solving the problem are **purposely** omitted to encourage additional self-directed research. This, especially, helps you develop some search skills for coding in Python (which is inevitable due to the inconsistent syntax of Python).\n",
        "  + Do not hesitate to communicate your questions to the TA's or instructors. \n",
        "    \n",
        "  Good luck! "
